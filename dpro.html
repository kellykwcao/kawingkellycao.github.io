        <h2>Course Description:</h2>
        <p>As a participant in the Bernard M. Gordon-MIT Engineering Leadership Program (GEL Program), I opted for the elective course D-PRO Rapid Prototyping (16.810) to fulfill the requirements of the Design and Innovation Leadership track. The central objective of D-PRO revolves around providing students with an encompassing comprehension of the design process within the intricate context of engineering industries.

            This encompasses the entirety of phases from ideation and design to the creation of prototypes and the rigorous testing of multidimensional components or systems. What truly sets this course apart is its distinctive amalgamation of conventional classroom pedagogy with pragmatic, hands-on exploration. It presents a stimulating challenge to small cohorts of students, requiring them to collaboratively conceptualize and realize solutions tailored to a modified real-world scenario.
            
            </p>
        <h2>Project Description:</h2>
        <p>As part of this course, we were tasked with engaging in a team-based design competition, where we had to develop a competitive solution that not only met stringent cost and performance criteria but also addressed the evolving need for next-generation air quality systems in vehicle cabins. The core objective of this competition was to reimagine cabin comfort and health as automotive manufacturers make the shift towards an all-electric vehicle lineup. Within this context, each team was entrusted with the responsibility of not only reducing the likelihood of viral disease transmission within the cabin, as compared to conventional cabins, but also achieving on-par or enhanced climate control system performance, all while minimizing the consumption of electrical power. Given the constraints of electric vehicles relying solely on battery power, every ounce of energy was crucial.
            
            Finally, we were responsible for meeting 16 design requirements and were scored by the "vehicle maker" on both "cost" and "performance" metrics. This evaluation laid the groundwork for a spirited competition among the teams, all vying to secure a supplier contract from the vehicle manufacturer, thus showcasing innovative problem-solving skills, creative design acumen, and product management techniques. </p>
