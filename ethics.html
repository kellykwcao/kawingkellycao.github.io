        <h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p>As a CS major curious about the intersection of the internet and society, the opportunity to take a course on Experiential Ethics at MIT allowed me to 
        have conversations with leaders in undustry, academia, and the public sector about the significance of ethics in shaping new technologies. As technology becomes ubiquitious, this course 
        inspired me to delve deeper into the ethical dimensions of my own values and the broader moral, social, and poltiical implications of my past internship experiences and technical coursework. </p>
        <h2>Final Project:</h2>
        <p>For our final project, I decided to focus on the ethics of online crowdsourcing. Specifically, Amazon Mechanical Turk is a pervasive tool researchers now use to conduct online surveys and studdies. Although the merits to using this tool are undoubtable, I wanted to investigate the ethical underpinnings behind using them, as the mere $0.10 compensation for each MTurk task seemed dubiously low. 
            Since many Psychology and Computer Science research relies so heavily on MTurk, I wanted to learn more about the current ethical standards/considersations and (hopefully) encourage institutions to think more holistically and critically about their utilization of online crowdsourcing platforms. </p>
